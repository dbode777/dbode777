- 👋 Hi, I’m Dalton Bode
- 👀 I’m interested in data analytics, backend development and physics (more specifically materials physics, condensed matter physics, and cosmology). 
I enjoy working out and playing challenging video games. 
- 🌱 I’m currently working as an associate software developer and currently aiming to specialize in backend development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on research and development for semiconductors, superconductors, batteries, business analytics, game development, or backend development.
